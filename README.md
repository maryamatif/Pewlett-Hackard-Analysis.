# SILVER TSUNAMI

## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
The purpose of this project was to analyze the human resource data of an organizaiton using sql and figure out how many employees have reached retirement age and also how many employees are eligible for the mentorship program hosted by the organization.

## RESULTS
1. A total of 90,398 employees have reached the retirement age which is a siginficant amount for the company.
2. The majority of retirement qualified employees are currently Senior Engineers or senior staff members.
The managers of the organization seem to be quite young as only 2 have reached their retirement age.
A total of 1,549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program hosted by the organization. 

## SUMMARY
### 1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
A total of 90,398 roles will need to be filled as the silver tsunami begins to make an impact. That is a signifcant number but we are making the assumption that all titles/roles will need to be filled. 

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
There are more than enough employees who are retirement ready who can be mentors for the existing or next generate of PewLett Hackard employees. However, a better analysis would be to create a neq table that lists the retired employees and the mentorship eligible employees per department as an employee can generally only provide mentorship to the people who are in his/her department.
